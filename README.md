Adapting Locality Sensitive Hashing for Higher Efficiency and Safer Machine Learning

Final Project for Harvard CS 242: Computing at Scale

Collaborators: Justin Ye, Richard Lun, William Cooper


This repository contains the code with which we used to test the use of locality-sensitive hashing on
inputs of neural networks to speed up training. models.py contains modified MLP and GNN skeleton code,
which systematic-parameter-tuning.py and hashed_gnn.py then test.
